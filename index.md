### Feature specification document: Facebook Comments Feature

#### Background

From the day one official idea and concept of Facebook was being a tool to connect people, their families and their friends. Therefore for Facebook brand and business, comments are great communication instrument to develop. Another reason is opportunity for bigger amount of people to communicate publicly. This tool opens up possibility to spread interesting facts, knowledge or news among bigger amount of people and do it much faster than it is by using only private massages or posts.

#### Feature value and objective

#### How does it work?

As a user of social network Facebook you can take part in public communication by leaving a comment under your own or someone's post, photo, video or live video stream. You can use additional features like attaching photo, stickers, GIFs or emojis to your own comment or send a reaction to someone else's comment

#### Mockups:

#### Mobile app

-   comments under photo on user page

-   comments under post in news feed

#### Web browser

#### User scenarios

Ann is a content manager for a booking agency. Every time there is a new event coming on she makes a post about it including specific details like date, venue, prices, maybe some limitations on the entrance. Usually there's a lot of questions and reactions in the comments of the post. They contain everything from emotional reactions about upcoming event to organisational questions about place, tickets or date. As a content manager Ann can use this questions in next posts functional requirement, make them clearer and do her job better.

Max is a support manager for a booking agency were Ann is working. He helps with all the questions and problems that customers have. They can send questions by email, call by the phone, write a personal massage to a Facebook page, or leave the comment under the post they have questions about. The last one is especially helpful for Max because he can reply publicly to customers comments so that other customers with the same questions can see it.

Jack bought a ticket for upcoming concert of the band he've been a fan of for a long time. The band is brought to the city by the booking agency were Ann and Max are working. Jack knows that the agency has an active facebook page so he goes to check it out. There he sees the post about event he've bought a ticket to and starts to interact with other people in the comments showing that he's happy and looking forward to go there. He send photos of himself with the band in other city, use funny stickers and communicates actively.

The moderator who is interested in activity on the page sees it and makes a context to get a free ticket for being the most active fan. Surely Jack wins the ticket and takes his friend to the concert for free.
