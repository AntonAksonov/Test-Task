### Executive summary

The executive summary indicates the purpose and content of the rest of the document. It describes the project's primary goal, the issue it is facing and has a few words about how great the client's decision to choose your company was.


### Project overview and objectives

In this section, you'll go into detail about the project. It would be best if you considered including overall goals for the project, a description of what the project will accomplish, the background of the project, business drivers that make this project necessary (operational, market, environmental, financial), and a description of the current and proposed process(better-using visualization)


### Business requirements

Here is where you'll cover your goals in greater detail. The description has to be specific, measurable, actionable, realistic, and time-bound (SMART). Consider your priorities. For example, designate your requirements as critical, high priority, medium priority, low priority, or a future requirement.


### Project Solution

Description of what new solution brings to client business and overall strategy. What are the following objectives that should occur upon the full implementation of the project?

### Scope

The project scope is one of the most critical sections in your BRD. It explains what your organization and vendor are responsible for. Good to be as detailed as possible and don't make any assumptions. 


### Features

The list of features that the company will introduce upon completion of the project. Including a brief description of what it should give to the user for every specific feature.


### Functional requirements

The Functional requirements section is where to put more details about the structure behind what the user of the end product or service sees. You may add appropriate subsections, data flow diagrams, and flowcharts. Describe methodology framework (Agile, Waterfall, Scrum, Kanban). Provide a visualization of system use cases with a text description of what changes were put in place by the project.  

### Personnel requirements

For some business projects, the identity of personnel is just as critical as any other requirements. Therefore, include enough detail to address those needs in the context of the rest of the project and any potential impacts on the project budget.


### Assumptions

The assumptions outline anticipated events that would occur during the project.

### Quality assurance and reporting

The Reporting and Quality Assurance section will outline how progress is being measured and assessed along the way. Clearly define the methods employed to oversee progress on the project 

### Delivery schedule

Both final deadlines and detail around milestones.

### Cost & Benefit

This section holds a detailed list of all the costs involved in the project along with the cost-benefit analysis. 

### Risks

Every project has inherent risks that may cause delay or even failure of a project. 
Describe any risks that might arise with the technology used to build or support the project. Description of any risks that might arise regarding the skills necessary to deliver the project. Description of any risks arising from internal business environment forces or those caused by local, state, or country changes. Description of any risks to the company if the project ends up getting canceled or delayed. Description of any risks that could arise because of issues with the requirements. For example, what could happen to the project timeline if you discovered that a section of the requirements was incomplete.


### Glossary of Terms

Add a glossary if there are a lot of technical terms that need defining to add clarity to the document. 


2.Feature specification document  <a name="feature"></a>
==============================

> [**Features specification**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_specification) is a part of a BRD

#### Main components of Feature specification

*   Background
*   Feature value and objective
*   Value proposition diagram
*   How it works
*   Mockups
*   User scenarios
*   Functional and Non-Functional requirements
*   User Stories
*   Metrics
    

### Feature specification document: [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) Comments Feature

#### Background

From day one, Facebook's main idea and concept is a tool to connect people, their families, and friends. Therefore for Facebook's brand and business, comments are a great communication instrument to develop. Another reason is an opportunity for a more significant amount of people to communicate publicly. Therefore, this tool opens up the possibility of spreading exciting facts, knowledge, or news among many people and doing it much faster than using only private messages or posts.


#### Feature value and objective

<img src="docs/assets/value.png" alt="drawing" />

#### How it works

As a user of the social network Facebook you can take part in public communication by leaving a comment under your own or someone's post, photo, video, or live video stream. In addition, you can use additional features like attaching pictures, stickers, GIFs, or emojis to your comment or send a reaction to someone else's comment.


#### Mockups:

#### User scenarios

* Ann is a content manager for a booking agency. Every time there is a new event coming on, she posts about it, including specific details like date, venue, prices, and maybe some limitations on the entrance. Usually, there's a lot of questions and reactions in the comments under the post. They contain everything from emotional reactions about an upcoming event to organizational questions about the place, tickets, or date. As a content manager, Ann can use these questions in the following posts as a functional requirement, make them more straightforward and do her job better.


* Max is a customer support manager for a booking agency where Ann is working. He helps with all the questions and problems that customers have. They can send questions by email, call by phone, write a personal message to a Facebook page, or leave a comment under the post. The last one is beneficial for Max because he can reply publicly to customers' comments so that other customers with the same questions can see it.

* Jack bought a ticket for the band's upcoming concert he's been a fan of for a long time. The band is brought to the city by the booking agency where Ann and Max are working. Jack knows that the agency has an active Facebook page, so he goes to check it out. He sees the post about the event he's bought a ticket to and starts interacting with other people in the comments, showing that he's happy and looking forward to going there. He sends photos of himself with the band in another city, uses funny stickers, and communicates actively. The moderator interested in the activity on the page sees it and makes a context to get a free ticket for being the most active fan. Surely Jack wins the ticket and takes his friend to the concert for free.

* Is it meant that all User stories 'So thats' should be unique?
